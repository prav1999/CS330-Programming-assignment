Python was used as the programming language to execute the program and Visual Studio Code was used to write this program.

To create a executable file:
Step 1: Open Windows Command Prompt and then type the "pip install pyinstaller" command to install the PyInstaller package.

Step 2: Save the created Python script at location where you will be able to run the executable file.

Step 3: Create a executable file using "pyinstaller --onefile Praveen_CS330.py"

Step 4: Go to the previous location where you saved the Python script, there should be a dist folder containing the Application. Double click on it to run the file

Step 5: The code allows the user to enter their student ID, which is then used to get the unlocking and locking codes. The code will then accept a string of numbers from the user and will check to see if the unlocking or locking code is contained within it. If so, then appropriate action will be taken (lock or unlock).
